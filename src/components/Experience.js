            <p>NewlyWords is a React & Ruby memory book platform where hundreds of users per day can invite their friends & family to collaborate on a commemorative digital or physical book.</p>

            <p>I built the Questionnaire as a the new memory book content type, providing project owners a place to ask their contributors questions to answer for their collaborative memory book content.</p>
            <p>I developed a design guide with classNamees and partials, from the product design system, to build stylesheets which implemented reusable classnames and styles.</p>
            <p>I mentored a junior ui/ux designer by providing design advice to help him utilize Figma features more robustly, and to think about user experience from our userâ€™s perspective, following a contextual flow of page elements.</p>
