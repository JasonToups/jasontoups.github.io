          <h3>Newlywords</h3>
          <p>
            NewlyWords is a React & Ruby memory book platform where hundreds of
            users per day can invite their friends & family to collaborate on a
            commemorative digital or physical book.
          </p>
          <p>
            I engineered the Memory Book Project Dashboard in React with custom
            Hooks, where project owners view and edit pages submitted from their
            contributors, and view information about their book.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built the Questionnaire as a the new memory book content type,
            providing project owners a place to ask their contributors questions
            to answer for their collaborative memory book content.
          </p>
          <p>
            I developed a design guide with classNames and partials, from the
            product design system, to build stylesheets which implemented
            reusable classnames and styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mentored a junior ui/ux designer by providing design advice to
            help him utilize Figma features more robustly, and to think about
            user experience from our userâ€™s perspective, following a contextual
            flow of page elements.
